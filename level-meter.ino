/*implements a "level meter" using these three LEDs. 
When the potentionmeter is turned all the way counter-clockwise, all LEDs should be off. 
As you turn it clockwise, each subsequent LED should turn on as the rotation passes 1/4, 2/4, and 3/4 of the way around.
You can base your code on the Analog Input sketch we used in class
(found in the Arduino IDE under File > Examples > Analog > AnalogInput). 
You won't need blinking, but you will need an if statement
that checks the sensorValue to see how rotated your potentiometer is.*/
